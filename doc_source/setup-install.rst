Set Up the |sdk-java-v2|
#########################

This topic describes how to set up and use the |sdk-java| in your project.

Prerequisites
=============

To use the |sdk-java|, you must have:

* A suitable :ref:`Java Development Environment <java-dg-java-env>`.

* An AWS account and access keys. For instructions, see :doc:`signup-create-iam-user`.

* AWS credentials (access keys) set in your environment, or use the shared credentials file used by
  the AWS CLI and other SDKs. For more information, see :doc:`setup-credentials`.


.. _include-sdk:

Including the SDK in Your Project
=================================

Depending on your build system or IDE, use one of the following methods:

* **Apache Maven** |ndash| If you use |mvnlong|_, you can specify only the SDK components
  you need or the entire SDK (not recommended) as dependencies in your project.
  See :doc:`setup-project-maven`.

* **Gradle** |ndash| If you use Gradle_, you can import the Maven Bill of Materials (BOM) to your
  Gradle project to automatically manage SDK dependencies. See :doc:`setup-project-gradle`.

.. note:: Any build system that supports MavenCentral as an artifact source may be used. However we
   will not provide a downloadable zip for the developer preview.

.. _install-prev-sdk:

Compiling the SDK
=================

You can build the |sdk-java| using Maven. Maven downloads all necessary dependencies, builds the SDK,
and installs the SDK in one step. See http://maven.apache.org/ for installation instructions and more information.

.. topic:: To compile the SDK

    #. Open |sdk-java-github|_.

       .. note:: Version 1.0 of the SDK is also available in GitHub at |sdk-java-github-v1|_.

    #. Click the :guilabel:`Clone or download` button to choose your download option.

    #. In a terminal window, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the SDK source.

    #. Build and install the SDK by using the following command (Maven_ required).

       ::

        mvn clean install

       The resulting :file:`.jar` file is built into the :file:`target` directory.

    #. (Optional) Build the API Reference documentation using the following command.

       ::

        mvn javadoc:javadoc

       The documentation is built into the :file:`target/site/apidocs/` directories of each service.


.. _java-dg-java-env:

Installing a Java Development Environment
=========================================

The |sdk-java| requires Java *8.0 or later*. You can download the latest Java SE Development Kit 
software from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/. 

The |sdk-java| also works with `OpenJDK <https://openjdk.java.net/>`_ and |JDKlong| a distribution of the Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK). Download the latest OpenJDK version from https://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html. Download the latest |JDKlong8| or |JDKlong11| version from https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/.

Choosing a JVM
==============

For the best performance of your server-based applications with the |sdk-java|, we recommend
that you use the *64-bit version* of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This JVM runs only in server
mode, even if you specify the ``-Client`` option at run time.
